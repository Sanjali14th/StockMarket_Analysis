# Exploring and Cleaning a Dataset with String Values

This Colab notebook demonstrates how to load, clean, and analyze a dataset that might contain non-numeric values in specific columns.

**Description:**

The notebook assumes the dataset has a column that could contain string values like "Medium" instead of expected numerical values. It provides examples of how to handle such data to prepare it for further analysis.

**Libraries:**

- pandas
- numpy (or other libraries used)

**Usage:**

1. Mount your Google Drive by clicking "Runtime" -> "Change runtime type" and selecting a runtime with GPU or TPU acceleration (if applicable).
2. Run all code cells by clicking "Runtime" -> "Run all cells".

**Data Cleaning:**

The notebook specifically addresses the issue of "Medium" values by:

* **(Replace with your specific data cleaning step)**
* Explaining the reason behind this choice (e.g., ensuring consistency for numerical analysis).
