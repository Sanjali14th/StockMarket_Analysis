**Exploring and Cleaning a Dataset with String Values**

This Colab notebook demonstrates how to load, clean, and analyze a dataset that contains non-numeric values (e.g., "Medium") within numerical columns.

**Description:**

Many real-world datasets contain inconsistencies or unexpected data types. This notebook focuses on handling string values that disrupt numerical calculations. It provides practical examples and explanations for cleaning and transforming such data.

**Libraries:**

pandas
numpy (or other libraries as needed)

**Usage:**

Mount your Google Drive if necessary.
Run all code cells to execute the cleaning and analysis steps.
Data Cleaning:

**This notebook addresses the challenge of string values within numerical columns by:**

Replacing "Medium" values with numerical equivalents: For example, converting "Medium" to the numerical midpoint of the expected range.
Reason: Ensures data consistency for numerical calculations and visualizations.
Handling other string values (if present): Implementing appropriate strategies based on data context (e.g., removing outliers, imputing missing values).

**Additional Considerations:**

Data exploration: Visualizing data distributions and summary statistics to identify potential issues.
Error handling: Implementing robust error handling mechanisms to prevent unexpected behavior.
Domain knowledge: Leveraging domain expertise to make informed cleaning decisions.
By following these steps and considering the additional points, you can effectively prepare your dataset for further analysis and modeling.
